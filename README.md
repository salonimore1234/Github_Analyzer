# Problem Statement
With the increasing use of GitHub by developers and organizations, it can be time-consuming to manually explore and analyze individual user profiles and repositories to understand a developer's impact or code contributions. GitHub’s vast data needs a quick and efficient way to retrieve and present a user’s profile information and repository statistics in a clear and accessible format.

The GitHub Profile Analyzer aims to solve this by providing a simple tool that allows users to input a GitHub username and receive an analysis of that profile’s details, including:

   Basic user information (e.g., followers, following, and public repositories count).

   Detailed information about the user’s repositories (e.g., stars, forks, and open issues).

   This tool provides a centralized and visually appealing way to analyze GitHub profiles and can be useful for:

   Employers evaluating a candidate's GitHub presence.

   Developers quickly reviewing their own or peers' GitHub activity.

   Users discovering the most popular repositories and projects for a given username.

# Key Problems Solved

  Manual Profile Checking: The analyzer automates fetching GitHub user and repository data, reducing the need for manual searching and analysis.

  Data Visualization: Presents data in a structured, easy-to-read format (e.g., tables for repositories) to make the analysis process intuitive.

  Time Efficiency: Quickly retrieves and summarizes important profile information and repository metrics in real-time.
